            The Information Technology Institute (ITI) was established back in 1993 and became one of the MCIT’s affiliates in 2005. Its main mission revolves around ICT human capacity development. For over 30 years, ITI has kept updating its training portfolio through continuous monitoring of future global tech trends, as well as the country’s national and mega projects. As a result, it sustained an 85% employment percentage for its graduates. ITI programs served thousands of Egyptian youth from different Egyptian governorates, who graduated from different academic backgrounds, thanks to the rich programs that built on their academic experience leveraging their future employment opportunities. These programs include development, content design, game development, Geographic Information System, media and animation, cloud, security, data analytics, among others. ITI has a wide network of relations with industry and academia, empowering its curriculum and helping in reaching out talents in most of Egypt’s universities and governorates.
